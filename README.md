# 365DaysOfCode
My journey starting over in learning, as I strive to get the expertise I wish to have in the data world. Coding a little every day, as Rafiki says "A journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step".


2025 is a year of starting over for me, where i wish to realign with certain disciplines and commitments. It was only fit that I challenge myself in the data world. I'll be using several (free)resources through the year, from books, videos, tutorials and many more. I'll be sharing my work on here to document my progress and projects (big and small) as well as giving access to anyone who wants to borrow a leaf or two.

Cheers!
